# demo
 PostgresSQL spring boot project

 This is my demo project to link SpringBoot, postgressql, use Visual Studio for development and all the things.  Yay, I can retrieve from the database.

 Next question, what should the front end be? Or should it just be an API situation?

 Also, need to build more tests in.
